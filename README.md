I'm excited to share my latest project with you all. It's a game built with React called Tenzies, and I think you'll love it! One of my favourite features of the game is that you can track your high score. My personal best so far is 28, and I would love to see what high score you can achieve as well. Feel free to leave your high score in the comments section below. Give Tenzies a try and let me know what you think!
